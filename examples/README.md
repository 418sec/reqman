Examples are in ".yml" files, just because github use colored syntax for yaml files ; it's better displayed as is. But you can use ".rml" files in place ! (github doesn't know that my rml files are just regular yaml files)

BTW, reqman.conf is a yaml file too, but the extension is important and unique (so, no colored syntax for this under github, sorry)
