# Reqman

**Reqman** is a [postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) killer. It deserves the same goal, but without GUI : you can test yours http things with commandline under any operating system.

All configurations is done via simple yaml files, editable with any text editors. Results are displayed in console and in an html output. It's scriptable, and can be used as a daemon/cron task to automate your tests.

**Reqman** shines with:

 * Tests http apis / website
 * Non regression tests
 * Automatic tests
 * Batch http process
 * TDD of apis

**Reqman**'s history : postman is cool, but is not adapted to non-tech people, to implement "tests" (need JS knowledge), when things going harder. Btw, it (the free version) is a mess when you want to share your tests in a source control system. And the lack of a headless mode (#), for scripting is problematic. So there were room for **reqman**. With **reqman** you can put your complex things in reqman.conf, and let your tests be simple, and easily maintenable by non-tech people. (#: nowadays, it exists, but it's complex to setup)

**Reqman**'s name is a joke, a contraction of "request" and "man" ... and it can do a lot more than just POST requests ;-)
