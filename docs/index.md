# Reqman

Reqman is a [postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) killer. It deserves the same goal, but without GUI : you can test yours http things with commandline under any os.

All configurations is done via simple yaml files, editable with any text editors. Results are displayed in console and in an html output. It's scriptable, and can be used as a daemon/cron task to control your tests.
